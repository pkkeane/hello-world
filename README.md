# About Me:

My name is Pamela Kay Keane.
But, most people call me Pam.  
My mom used to call me PK, so I guess that's sort of my nickname.

I have three boys:  David, Owen, and Duncan.

I have four pets:
  - three cats:  Squeek, Bernard, and Paku
  - one dog:  Buddy

My career so far has been as a high school mathematics teacher.
Now, I'm hoping to find a second career in GIS!
